# Bildergeschichten/Picture Stories

“Bildergeschichten” is a mobile mixed reality application made with Vuforia SDK in Unity. 
The project consists of two picture frames, which people can interact with. 
The frames change what is displayed inside by the user's actions.

When talking about “Bildergeschichten” it is of utmost importance to state that it is not a game! 
This project was our way to bring inanimate objects to life, while maintaining our feet in the ground: 
It has no real objective apart from letting the user interact with and experience a digital, non-existent world. 
In the project there are two picture frames and four smaller marker elements the user can move around. 
Using the Samsung Gear VR the user sees a digital overlay on the pictures, representing the way to bring them to our world. 
This overlay has more details, containing different elements which cannot be seen in the analog world, 
and drags the user into another reality made out of digital and real fundamentals.
